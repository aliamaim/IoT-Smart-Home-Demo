# IoT-Smart-Home-Demo
This project is a smart home demo, in which the **Raspberry Pie** represents the **Controller** that the user is gonna directly interface with. (readings are sent to it and control over the house is through it), the **NodeMCU ESP8266** is the **IoT Platform** used at home to perform the orders sent by the Raspberry Pie and to send back the readings from different sensors, and a regular **PC** is used as a simulation to of a **server** which listens to the readings sent by the NodeMCU and saves the data for statistics and analysis.
